# 04 WebAPIs: Coding-Quiz

## Built out logic for a solar system quiz using html, css, and Javascript.

Below is a guide of how I built a quiz on our solar system. As an aspiring junior developer, my goal was to create a quiz on our solar system that had a timer and would track high scores for users after completion. This is the first project I've tackled coding with Javascript. It pushed me to learn and grow tremendously. I hope you enjoy the product. 

- Built out skeleton html structure for the quiz page.

- Adding basic CSS styling as most of my time was spent building out the logic with Javascript.

- Declared as many variables that I was able to think of to begin, including userScore, startbutton, answer buttons, quiz questions/answers and the question/answer container.

- Created the start quiz function that would hide the start button and begin the quiz timer that included an event listener for the start/restart button.

- Added function to clear current question and add a new question with a set of possible answers.

- Added logic that would compare user selected answer to the correct answer.

- If user selected answer was the same as the correct answer, user score would be increased.

- Built logic for if timer expired or user answered all available questions, quiz ends and user score is displayed.

- Added HighScore Button that will display high scores stored in local storage.
